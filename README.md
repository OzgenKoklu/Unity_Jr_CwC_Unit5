# Unity Learn JR pathway
Unity Learn JR path is awesome, I would suggest it to anyone who wants to learn how to make games. It does also give important tips and tricks on what you should do in order to have a clean looking code. 

Here is my profile in Unity Learn: https://learn.unity.com/u/ozgen_koklu

28.04.2022 - Added challenge scene to the repo. Including a whack 'em all style game. 

Optional challenges from main prototype still missing. Will add them soon.

# Short Gameplay clip - (coming after I complete bonus challenges)

This was the most complete pack yet. It is completely playable, and if you wanna play it, here is the link for the WebGL version: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-185685

In Unity Learn, there are some game logic challenges that are completely optional, they go from easy to hard, and generally include things that are beyond the scope of the educational material\ 
I find it fun to complete them, I will soon complete them when I have some spare time, and when I do, I will put a gameplay video here.

# Notes
This project was done for learning purposes.\
I was away from unity for the last 2-3 months, to revitalize my skills and get faster for my future work, I followed the step by step tutorials offered by Unity. \
I completed Unit 3 in around 5-10 hours since I already knew how to use unity.
